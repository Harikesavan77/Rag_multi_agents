### RAG-Powered-MultiAgent-Q&A Assistant

This project is a Streamlit-based Sustainability Knowledge Assistant powered by Googleâ€™s Gemini model.
It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a FAISS vector store to answer environment-related questions from a curated knowledge base.
The app also includes a built-in calculator for arithmetic queries. Users can interact through a clean UI that switches between calculator, direct LLM, and 
retrieval-based answering modes.
